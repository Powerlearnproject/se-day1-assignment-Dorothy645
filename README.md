The goal is to create a roadmap for the entire project.

2. Requirement Analysis
Software requirements are gathered from stakeholders (clients, users, business analysts).
Functional and non-functional requirements are documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
Helps ensure that the software meets business needs.

3. Design
The system architecture and technical specifications are created.
High-level design (HLD) outlines system structure, modules, and data flow.
Low-level design (LLD) defines detailed components, algorithms, and database structures.

4. Implementation (Coding)
Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Programming languages and frameworks are selected based on project needs.
Code is version-controlled using tools like Git.

5. Testing
The software is tested to identify and fix defects.
Different types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Ensures the software functions as intended and meets quality standards.

6. Deployment
The final software is released to production or made available to end users.
Deployment can be done in stages (e.g., phased rollout, blue-green deployment).
Cloud-based or on-premises deployment strategies may be used.

7. Maintenance and Support
Post-deployment, software requires regular updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
Security patches and enhancements are applied over time.
Ensures long-term stability and usability of the software.
